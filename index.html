        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>I am a Seattle-based woodworker and educator with a passion for technology. I design unique pieces of furniture with a great aim at functionality and space saving. I draw all my sketches in Vectorworks before I build any of pieces. As an educator I have extensively used technology to enhance the learning experience of my students. Iâ€™ve developed curriculums for 1:1 iPad schools and trained other teachers on how to use technology in the classrooms extensively. I first got introduced to programing in 2008 during my instructional technology courses. I am passionate about creating meaningful experiences for people and their interactions with technology.</p>
